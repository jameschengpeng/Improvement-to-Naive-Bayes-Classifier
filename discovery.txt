adult.csv dataset:
When trying to apply simulated annealing to find the optimal categorization for multiple continuous features for the pure comonotonic classifier, I made a mistake at first. I change the initially UNcategorized dataframe after each accuracy test (note that in different accuracy tests, the categorization methods are different). It means that I conduct categorization to the same dataframe in every iteration. This sounds strange but the truth is that after a number of re-categorizations, the accuracy of pure comonotonic classifier really increases to around 78%. The accuracy history also converges.
Then I corrected the mistake in the code. This time I no longer modify the dataframe that I pass in the accuracy_test function, which means that every time I use a different categorization to the original Uncategorized dataset. In this way, simulated annealing performed bad. The accuracy history oscillates and no longer converges! This is confusing.
